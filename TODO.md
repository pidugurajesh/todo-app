# Todo List Web App Development Plan

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Create project directories (server and client)
- [x] Set up backend: Create server.js and package.json for Express server
- [x] Install backend dependencies (express)
- [x] Set up frontend: Create React app in client directory
- [x] Install frontend dependencies (react, react-dom, etc.)
- [x] Implement Todo component with add, delete, toggle functionality
- [x] Add localStorage persistence for todos
- [x] Style the app: Make it attractive and responsive with CSS
- [x] Test the application by running the server and client
- [x] Final verification and cleanup
- [x] Install react-icons for FontAwesome icons
- [x] Implement dark/light theme toggle with localStorage
- [x] Add task filter options (All / Completed / Pending)
- [x] Add search bar to filter tasks dynamically
- [x] Enhance UI: Rounded cards, shadows, animations, pastel/gradient background, minimal centered design

## Notes
- Backend serves static files from client build.
- Frontend uses localStorage for data persistence and theme preference.
- Ensure responsiveness with media queries.
